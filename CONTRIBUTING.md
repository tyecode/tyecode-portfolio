## üìã Contribution Guidelines

### **Types of Contributions Welcome**
- üé® **UI/UX Improvements**: Enhanced animations, better responsive design, accessibility improvements
- ‚ö° **Performance Optimizations**: Bundle size reduction, loading speed improvements, Core Web Vitals
- üß© **Component Enhancements**: Reusable components, design system improvements
- üîß **Code Quality**: TypeScript improvements, better error handling, code organization
- üì± **Mobile Experience**: Touch interactions, mobile-specific optimizations
- ‚ôø **Accessibility**: ARIA improvements, keyboard navigation, screen reader support
- üìù **Documentation**: Code comments, README updates, component documentation

### **Code Standards**
- **TypeScript**: All new code must be written in TypeScript with proper type definitions
- **Components**: Use functional components with React hooks
- **Styling**: Utilize Tailwind CSS utility classes, avoid custom CSS when possible
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach using Tailwind's responsive prefixes
- **Accessibility**: Include proper ARIA labels, semantic HTML, and keyboard navigation
- **Performance**: Optimize images, use lazy loading, minimize bundle size

### **Development Workflow**

1. **Before Starting**
   - Check existing issues to avoid duplicate work
   - Discuss major changes in an issue first
   - Ensure your Node.js version is 18+ and pnpm is installed

2. **While Developing**
   - Write clean, self-documenting code
   - Test on multiple screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
   - Verify accessibility with screen readers and keyboard navigation
   - Check performance with Lighthouse
   - Ensure TypeScript compilation passes without errors

3. **Before Submitting**
   - Run the build command to ensure production readiness
   - Test all interactive elements and animations
   - Verify responsive design on different devices
   - Check for console errors and warnings

## **Commit Message Convention**

This project uses [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for automated versioning and changelog generation.

**Format**: `<type>[optional scope]: <description>`

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature (correlates with MINOR version)
- `fix`: Bug fix (correlates with PATCH version)
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that don't affect code meaning (formatting, missing semicolons)
- `refactor`: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Changes to build process or auxiliary tools

**Examples:**
```bash
feat(ui): add smooth scroll animation to navigation
fix(responsive): resolve mobile menu overflow issue
docs(readme): update installation instructions
style(components): format code with prettier
perf(images): implement lazy loading for project gallery
```

## **Pull Request Guidelines**

1. **PR Title**: Use conventional commit format
2. **Description**: Clearly describe what changes were made and why
3. **Screenshots**: Include before/after screenshots for UI changes
4. **Testing**: Describe how you tested the changes
5. **Breaking Changes**: Clearly mark any breaking changes
